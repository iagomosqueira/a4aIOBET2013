A recently developed statistical catch-at-age stock assessment method, designed for evaluating the status of stocks with intermediate data quality, is applied here to Indian Ocean bigeye tuna. The method provides huge flexibility for the rapid evaluation of the effects in parameter estimates and uncertainty of different submodels for fishing mortality-at-age (the F model), survey catchability-at-age (the Q model), stock recruitment (the R model) and observation variance (the V model).

The model does not attempt to substitute more complex stock assessments that make use of all sources of data, like tagging, but to provide a tool for rapid exploration of the influence of different assumptions and data sources. This capability is achieved by combining a powerful optimization engine (ADMB) with an intuitive user interface usaing linear models as expressed in the R language.
